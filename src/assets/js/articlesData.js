        <h2>1. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</h2>
        <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Hypertension is a condition where the force of the blood against artery walls is consistently too high. It's often called the "silent killer" because it may have no obvious symptoms.</p>
        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Headaches, fatigue, vision problems, irregular heartbeat. Often, there are no symptoms until damage occurs.</p>
        <p><strong>Causes and Risk Factors:</strong> Obesity, high salt intake, lack of exercise, stress, smoking, alcohol.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention and Control:</strong> Reduce salt, eat healthy, exercise, avoid smoking and alcohol, manage stress, check BP regularly.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Type 2 Diabetes</h2>
        <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> A chronic condition where the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn’t produce enough of it. This leads to high blood sugar levels over time.</p>
        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue, blurry vision, slow wound healing, weight loss.</p>
        <p><strong>Causes and Risk Factors:</strong> Poor diet, lack of exercise, obesity, genetics, age (typically 40+).</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention and Control:</strong> Healthy eating, regular physical activity, maintain healthy weight, reduce sugar intake, check blood glucose levels.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Anemia</h2>
        <p><strong>What It Is:</strong> Anemia happens when your blood lacks enough red blood cells or hemoglobin, which reduces oxygen delivery to tissues.</p>
        <p><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Fatigue, pale skin, dizziness, cold hands and feet, shortness of breath.</p>
        <p><strong>Causes and Risk Factors:</strong> Iron deficiency, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, chronic disease, heavy bleeding.</p>
        <p><strong>Prevention and Control:</strong> Eat iron-rich foods, take supplements as prescribed, treat any underlying condition, and avoid caffeine excess that inhibits iron absorption.</p>
        
        <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
        <p>These three health conditions are common but manageable. Early detection and lifestyle modifications can prevent long-term complications. Don’t ignore your symptoms — listen to your body and talk to your doctor.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Market Volatility</h2>
            <p>Cryptocurrency markets are known for their dramatic swings. Understanding the factors that drive these fluctuations is key to developing a sound investment strategy.</p>
            
            <h2>Diversification Strategies</h2>
            <p>Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Allocate your investments across different cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and traditional assets to mitigate risk.</p>
            
            <h2>Dollar-Cost Averaging</h2>
            <p>Instead of trying to time the market, invest fixed amounts at regular intervals. This approach smooths out purchase prices over time.</p>
            
            <h2>Risk Management</h2>
            <p>Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set clear stop-loss limits and take-profit targets to automate your exit strategy.</p>
